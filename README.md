# StoreChecker

This Flutter plugin is useful to find the origin of installed apk/ipa which is made available for download.

**Android**: It's very common to have Android applications republished on alternate markets or their APKs made available for download. The plugin detects whether app is installed from local source or Play Store or other stores

**iOS**: Detects whether we have installed from TestFlight Beta or App Store build

# Usage
You can use the StoreChecker to find the origin of apk/ipa. This works both on iOS and Android.
Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:
dependencies:
  store_checker: ^0.0.1

```dart
import 'package:store_checker/store_checker.dart';

Source installationSource = await StoreChecker.getSource;

String source = "";
switch(installationSource){
        case Source.IS_INSTALLED_FROM_PLAY_STORE:
          source = "Play Store";
          break;
        case Source.IS_INSTALLED_FROM_LOCAL_SOURCE:
          source = "Local Source";  //For example: Installed apk using adb commands, side loading or cloud
          break;
        case Source.IS_INSTALLED_FROM_OTHER_STORE:
          source = "Other Store";  //For example: Amazon app store
          break;
        case Source.IS_INSTALLED_FROM_APP_STORE:
          source = "App Store";
          break;
        case Source.IS_INSTALLED_FROM_TEST_FLIGHT:
          source = "Test Flight";
          break;
        case Source.UNKNOWN:
          source = "Unknown source";
          break;
      }
```
